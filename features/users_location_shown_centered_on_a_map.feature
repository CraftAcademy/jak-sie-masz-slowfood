Feature: User geo location
  As a system owner,
  In order to present restaurants in the user's area,
  I would like to access user's browser or IP address

  Background:
    Given the following restaurants exist
      | name                | city      |
      | Scott's Pizza Place | Stockholm |
      | Oliver's Burgers    | GÃ¶teborg  |

  And I am at latitude: "59.33", longitude: "18.05"

  Scenario: Users location is at the center of the map
    Given I visit the landing page
    And the map has been loaded
    Then the center of the map should be approximately "59.334591" lat and "18.063240" lng
