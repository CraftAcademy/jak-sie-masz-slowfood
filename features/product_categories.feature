    Scenario:
      When I visit the "Oliver's Burger" show page
      Then I would like to see "Chicken wings" under the "Starter" category
      And I would like to see "Double Burger" under the "Main Course" category
      And I would like to see "Apple pie" under the "Dessert" category
      And I would not like to see "Apple pie" under the "Starter" category
